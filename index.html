<div class="abstract-title"><h2>Description</h2></div>
wIRdle is an iteration of the popular NYT "Wordle" game where the user
has 6 tries to guess a target word. Once they input their choice the
game notifies them if the characters in that word are exact matches or
are positioned incorrectly. Our product is different as we use the IR
Remote as the input to control the character input. We also use AWS
Email Notification to send a report to the user about their game
performance. Apart from that we use Adafruit OLED Breakout Board to
display the tries and the game and also we use the BMA222 Accelerometer
which is used to reset the game once either the user wins the game or
loses it. We differ from this product because our project is not purely
web-based, which allows the users to play the core game without
requiring an internet connection. Only the AWS Email Notifications are
dependent on the internet which is completely optional. Additionally,
the best part about our game is that it can be played without internet
requiring only a power source for it to run. <br/><br/> Our source code

<p>One similar product out there is the New York Times' "Wordle" game,
where the user has to guess the target word in 6 guesses. Compared with
this product, our product provides a non-internet solution to the Wordle
where the user only needs to connect to a power source to play our game,
which also makes our portable and enjoyable anywhere.</p>

    As shown in the system flowchart, we use one of the CC3200 boards for
    the closed feedback loop for maintaining concentration in the
    environment. The board will read values with I2C protocol through an ADC
    which reads values from the thermistor and the TDS meter sensor. The
    board will also periodically read user-defined thresholds from the AWS
    cloud using RESTful APIs. When the sensory values read outside of the
    user-defined thresholds, the board will activate the motor control
    function to pump either water or nutrient solution to bring the
    concentration back within the thresholds. Meanwhile, another CC3200
    board is frequently reading from the AWS cloud to present the current
    TDS reading and user-defined threshold to the user on an OLED through
    SPI protocols. To adjust the thresholds, the user can either do it
    remotely or locally by using a TV remote to type the number into the IR
    receiver. The adjustments will be updated to the AWS and if the user
    updates remotely, the local CC3200 board will update the values in the
    next synchronization.

    Our system works based on the following state diagram. The device will
    periodically monitor the temperature and the electrical conductivity
    (EC) of the solution and convert the values into a TDS value using a
    calibration curve. At the same time, the device will check for threshold
    inputs, both over the AWS shadow and via manual input on the IR
    receiver. It will compare the TDS with the lower and upper thresholds
    set by the user. If the value is within the thresholds, it will stay in
    the rest state. If the TDS is higher than the upper thresholds, it will
    go to the water state and activate the water pump until the PPM is lower
    than the upper thresholds and go back to the rest state. If the PPM is
    lower than the lower thresholds, it will go to the nutrient state and
    activate the nutrient pump until the PPM is higher than the lower
    thresholds and go back to the rest state. In each state, the device will
    periodically post the TDS.

Board</h3>
<p>All control and logic was handled by a CC3200 microcontroller unit,
one each for the Master and Slave device. On the master device, it was
responsible for decoding IR inputs from the remote to allow the user to
input thresholds to be sent over AWS. The board’s SPI functionality,
using the TI SPI library, was used to interface with the OLED display.
The MCU is WiFi enabled, allowing a remote connection between the two
boards.</p>
<p>On the slave device, the microcontroller was responsible for the same
functionalities as above, in addition to the TDS reading and control.
This includes interfacing with the ADC over the I2C bus, reading
thresholds over HTTP from the AWS device shadow, writing the reported
TDS to the device shadow, and activating the two pumps using the BJT
control circuit.</p>

    The AWS IoT core allows our devices to communicate with each other
    asynchronously. The master device can update the desired thresholds, and
    the slave device will read them and synchronize them to the reported

    periodically.

    On both the Master and Slave devices, a user can input the TDS
    thresholds using a TV remote. These TV remotes use the NEC code format
    with a carrier frequency of 38KHz. The Vishay IR receiver is connected
    to Pin 62 of the CC3200, which is configured as a GPIO input pin. Each
    positive edge of the signal triggers an interrupt in the main program,
    storing the pulse distances into a buffer, and allowing us to decode the
    inputs (1-9, delete and enter). The IR receiver is connected to VCC
    through a resistor and a capacitor to filter any ripples.

    The outputs from the thermistor and TDS sensor board are
    in the form of analog voltages, which need to be converted to digital
    values to be usable in our program. We chose the AD1015 breakout board
    from Adafruit, which sports 4-channels and 12 bits of precision. We
    ended up using only 2 channels, so there is a potential for even more
    cost savings. The ADC board supports I2C communication, which we can use
    to request and read the two channel voltages.

    Conductivity-based TDS measurements are sensitive to temperature. To
    allow accurate TDS measurements in a variety of climates and seasons,
    temperature compensation calculations must be performed. To measure the
    temperature, we use an NTC thermistor connected in a voltage divider
    with a 10k resistor. The voltage across the resistor is read by the ADC
    and converted to temperature using the equation provided by the
    thermistor datasheet.

    In our first attempt to measure TDS, we used a simple two-probe analog
    setup with a voltage divider. We soon found out that this was a naïve
    approach (see Challenges). Consequently, we acquired a specialty TDS
    sensing board from CQRobot, which generates a sinusoidal pulse and
    measures the voltage drop to give a highly precise voltage to the ADC.
    The MCU can then convert this voltage to a TDS value using the equation
    provided by the device datasheet. We calibrated the TDS readings using a
    standalone TDS sensor pen. After calibration and setting up the curves
    for temperature compensation, we were able to achieve TDS readings
    accurate to within 5% of the TDS sensor pen.

    The CC3200 is unable to provide sufficient power to drive the pumps,
    which need 100mA of current each. Therefore, we used an external power
    source in the form of 2 AA batteries for each pump motor. To allow the
    CC3200 to turn on/off the motors, we designed a simple amplifier using a
    Common Emitter topology. When the control pin is asserted HIGH, the BJT
    will allow current to flow from 3V to ground through the pump motor.
    Conversely, if the control signal is LOW, the BJT will not allow current
    to flow in the motor. For each motor, there is a reverse-biased diode
    connected across it. This protects our circuit from current generated by
    the motor if it is spun from external force or inertia.

<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<p>The most significant challenge we faced while developing this
prototype was of the IR Receiver picking up multiple signals. This
occurred due to the way we had set up our Receiver to receive the
signals from the IR Remote and how we reset the sysTick count
values.</p>
<!-- ## Probe Channel Polarization

Our first design for the probe was simply two copper rods, which would
add as electrodes. This probe would be connected in series with a
1000-ohm resistor to act as a voltage divider. We would simply connect
the probe to VCC and measure the voltage divider through the ADC,
allowing us to calculate the EC. However, when we used the probe for a
few minutes, we realized that the EC value would continue to rise. This
is because the DC current causes an ionized channel to build up between
the two electrodes in the water. This cause inconsistent EC readings as
time goes on. -->

<!-- ## Current Limitation of GPIO Pins

Our next idea was to try using the GPIO pins to power the probe, since
we can turn it off when not needed, preventing excessive polarization.
However, the GPIO pins are current limited, and any control circuit with
a transistor would introduce extra voltage drops. Therefore, the simple
two-probe implementation was not feasible. -->

<h2 id="solution-to-challenges">Solution to Challenges</h2>
<p>We realized that waiting until everyone else is done using their
remote was not a feasible or a viable solution. So, to overcome this
issue, we started by reducing the time when we reset the sysTick count.
Initially, we would reset the sysTick count every 150 clock cycles, and
by trial and error method we got it down to 50 clock cycles, i.e., if
the IR Receiver detects an input it will reset when the sysTick count
reaches 50. Another, thing to note here is that in order to minimize the
incoming IR signals from other remotes nearby, we covered our circuit
using a carboard shoe box which helped us better implement the sysTick
count and reset it every 50 clock cycles.</p>
<h1 id="future-work">Future Work</h1>
<p>Currently our game has no function to recognize if the word that the
user guesses is a valid word or not. We could try to connect to some
external dictionary api to find matches and validate it, however the
drawbacks of this are that there is a lot of overhead when it comes to
checking the whole dictionary for each word the user guesses. Another
potential solution would be trying to implement conditions that check
for principle word rules such as "i before e except after c" to see if
the word is valid English. More improvements could be keeping track of
the time it took to solve the wordle to use as personal records. This
would use additional timers, etc.</p>
