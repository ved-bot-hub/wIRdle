<div class="abstract-title"><h2>Description</h2></div>
WIRDLE is an iteration of the popular NYT "Wordle" game where the user
has 6 tries to guess a target word. Once they input their choice the
game notifies them if the characters in that word are exact matches or
are positioned incorrectly. Our product is different as we use the IR
Remote as the input to control the character input. We also use AWS
Email Notification to send a report to the user about their game
performance. Apart from that we use Adafruit OLED Breakout Board to
display the tries and the game and also we use the BMA222 Accelerometer
which is used to reset the game once either the user wins the game or
loses it. We differ from this product because our project is not purely
web-based, which allows the users to play the core game without
requiring an internet connection. Only the AWS Email Notifications are
dependent on the internet which is completely optional. Additionally,
the best part about our game is that it can be played without internet
requiring only a power source for it to run. <br/><br/> Our source code

<p>One similar product out there is the New York Times' "Wordle" game,
where the user has to guess the target word in 6 guesses. Compared with
this product, our product provides a non-internet solution to the Wordle
where the user only needs to connect to a power source to play our game,
which also makes our portable and enjoyable anywhere.</p>

    The block diagram found in the right represents an abstraction of the
    component relationships that make up our project. Since the CC3200 is the
    primary MCU of the project, most peripherals will have to interface with it
    so that we can access the data and perform the necessary processing within
    the game logic. The BMA222 accelerometer points to the CC3200 because of how
    we mainly use it to read the accelerometer data through I2C. While we do write
    to the BMA222, this is only performed to mask the registers we want to ignore
    in preparation for the reading of the data. Additionally, the IR Remote
    transmitter is used to send RC-5 formatted sequences to the receiver circuit.
    The receiver circuit is not represented in the block diagram but can be
    interpreted as part of the CC3200 block since the receiver output connects to
    the GPIO pin of the MCU. Upon receiving the input data from both the BMA222 and
    IR remote, the CC3200 makes this input available through the program, utilizing
    it within the Game Reset and Game Logic blocks to evaluate and make decisions for
    the game state. The CC3200 points to the Adafruit OLED because of how the CC3200
    uses the Adafruit library and TI module functions to initialize and write to the
    SPI. This similar procedure is represented by the SPI Display function which consists
    of the various SPI commands used to form the basic game interface. When these display
    functions are called based on the state of the game logic block, SPI is still utilized
    to write to the OLED and draw new graphics on the display. Additionally, the game state
    logic controls the AWS Game Email Notification block which manages the logic of issuing
    a different message depending if the user has won or not. This process stores the
    message within a buffer to be sent to the device shadow state which is indexed via AWS
    and sent over email to the user.

  <div style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;flex:1 0 300px;">
    According to the flowchart in the figure to the right, the basic game logic functionality
    is described. Upon game initialization, various actions are performed. First, all of
    the peripheral dependencies and protocols are initialized, including SPI and I2C. In
    addition, GPIO and Systick are initialized to prepare for the interrupt handling upon
    each RC-5 sequence received. The game screen has to be drawn onto the Adafruit OLED
    through SPI and a new word is chosen to be the target for the game. Many of the processes
    lie within the IR functionality where if a 13-bit pulse sequence is detected, the GPIO
    handler will decode each pulse and measure the pulse times. A pulse can only successfully
    be decoded as a 0 bit if the pulse is within 600-680 µs, whereas a 1 bit is decoded with
    a window of 1000-2500 µs. If invalid data is interpreted within a sequence, the sequence
    should be reset so that the handler can detect additional sequences. Upon a successful
    sequence read, our program takes the 13-bit buffer and translates it into decimal which
    is used to assign a specifically unique character code. This character code is used for
    evaluation to determine what the user has inputted. For our IR remote, the MUTE key is
    used for deletion while the “1” key represents submission, any other input is used for
    character input. Depending on which scenario, the game issues the color-coded hints by
    drawing rectangles in the game screen grid. After every submission of a 5-letter word,
    game variables such as gameOver and gameWon are evaluated to check when to send the AWS
    post request so that an email notification may be received. The type of message is
    evaluated based on if the user won or lost, and this takes place after checking if the
    game is over at all. This whole process runs in parallel with our write/reads to the
    BMA222 to take the necessary orientation data. By maintaining storage of the BMA222 data
    across 50 iterations of the main function while looping, we can compare the front and end
    of this buffer to observe actual changes in value when the orientation of the device is altered.

<p>The implementation of the project design can be classified into the
program components that make up how the game features were coded, which
include the Wordle Game Logic, Game Reset, SPI Display, and AWS Game
Notification blocks. Alternatively, there are also the blocks that make
up the interfacing with peripheral components/services such as the IR
Remote, BMA222, Adafruit OLED, and AWS blocks.</p>

    In our program, we had functions that would initiate post requests to the AWS
    endpoint of our device shadow. We had to specifically list our endpoint and access
    point within the program since the CC3200 has SimpleLink Wi-Fi capability to make such
    requests. Additionally, we had to attach keys and certificates generated by AWS onto
    the device through AWS IoT and by flashing certificates onto the MCU. After providing
    the necessary permissions on AWS, most of the implementation depended on how we would
    store the game data and message within our code to be sent to AWS.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the game, there are either win or lose states once the game is over, which means a
    different message will be sent to the user via email upon each of these states. We create
    conditions that check if the game is over and whether it is a loss or win and use strcpy()
    to store the message within a char* variable. We configured a rule in AWS to respond to the
    change in device shadow state by indexing into the state JSON and sending our message data
    to the user’s email.

    The user can view the game itself on the OLED, where we had implemented some functions

    SPI display where the same functionality was used to set up the basic game screen upon
    starting the OLED. The users can also check if the characters in word they input were
    placed in the correct position, weere in the wrong position, or if the character was

    On both the Master and Slave devices, a user can input the TDS
    thresholds using a TV remote. These TV remotes use the NEC code format
    with a carrier frequency of 38KHz. The Vishay IR receiver is connected
    to Pin 62 of the CC3200, which is configured as a GPIO input pin. Each
    positive edge of the signal triggers an interrupt in the main program,
    storing the pulse distances into a buffer, and allowing us to decode the
    inputs (1-9, delete and enter). The IR receiver is connected to VCC
    through a resistor and a capacitor to filter any ripples.

<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<p>The most significant challenge we faced while developing this
prototype was of the IR Receiver picking up multiple signals. This
occurred due to the way we had set up our Receiver to receive the
signals from the IR Remote and how we reset the sysTick count
values.</p>
<!-- ## Probe Channel Polarization

Our first design for the probe was simply two copper rods, which would
add as electrodes. This probe would be connected in series with a
1000-ohm resistor to act as a voltage divider. We would simply connect
the probe to VCC and measure the voltage divider through the ADC,
allowing us to calculate the EC. However, when we used the probe for a
few minutes, we realized that the EC value would continue to rise. This
is because the DC current causes an ionized channel to build up between
the two electrodes in the water. This cause inconsistent EC readings as
time goes on. -->

<!-- ## Current Limitation of GPIO Pins

Our next idea was to try using the GPIO pins to power the probe, since
we can turn it off when not needed, preventing excessive polarization.
However, the GPIO pins are current limited, and any control circuit with
a transistor would introduce extra voltage drops. Therefore, the simple
two-probe implementation was not feasible. -->

<h2 id="solution-to-challenges">Solution to Challenges</h2>
<p>We realized that waiting until everyone else is done using their
remote was not a feasible or a viable solution. So, to overcome this
issue, we started by reducing the time when we reset the sysTick count.
Initially, we would reset the sysTick count every 150 clock cycles, and
by trial and error method we got it down to 50 clock cycles, i.e., if
the IR Receiver detects an input it will reset when the sysTick count
reaches 50. Another, thing to note here is that in order to minimize the
incoming IR signals from other remotes nearby, we covered our circuit
using a carboard shoe box which helped us better implement the sysTick
count and reset it every 50 clock cycles.</p>
<h1 id="future-work">Future Work</h1>
<p>While we were able to complete many of our target goals, there is
still much work to be done in terms of potential improvement and add-ons
to this prototype of the game. When compared to other existing market
solutions such as NYT’s “Wordle”, one important feature that isn’t
present in our iteration is word validation. In the web game, users are
prevented from entering 5-letter words that aren’t valid English words.
In our case, users can enter sequences of characters even if they do not
make much sense in terms of meaning. Potential improvements could
include connecting to an external dictionary API in which every time the
user submits a guess, the word is indexed through the dictionary to find
a match. If not, the word would be rejected and the player would have to
retry their attempt. The drawbacks of this solution are how performing
this type of indexing for every user attempt can utilize a large amount
of overhead, especially when the program would have to make several API
requests per game. Other implementations to this issue include possibly
checking the user guess with common word rules from the English language
such as “i before e except after c”. This method would be much more
optimal in terms of complexity. Other improvements include keeping track
of other types of meaningful data to report to the user upon a victory
or loss. Possible solutions are the utilization of other timers within
the TI module to keep track of the duration of each game. Upon each
victory, the user can be notified of personal records in regard to the
time it took for them to guess the target word. This would imply keeping
track of a persistent buffer to store past time records of previous
games.</p>
